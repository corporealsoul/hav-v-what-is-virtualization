## Component,

### Hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” (or “hosted”). A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host's hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.

**1. Native or bare-metal hypervisors,**

These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems.

1.  VMware vSphere / ESXi
    
2.  KVM
    
3.  Microsoft Windows Hyper-V
    
4.  Xen / Citrix XenServer
    

**2. Hosted hypervisors,**

These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host.
